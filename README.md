CodeAlpha_MusicRecommendationSystem
===
Iâ€™ve built a Music Recommendation System using machine learning techniques on the Spotify Dataset. This project demonstrates the end-to-end process, from data exploration and feature selection to building the recommendation system itself.

*Highlights of the Music Recommendation System:*
---
* Data Visualization: Detailed data analysis and visualization for understanding the dataset.
* Feature Selection: Selecting the most relevant features for improving recommendation accuracy.
* Clustering: Applying KMeans for clustering similar songs based on their features.
* Dimensionality Reduction: PCA and t-SNE were used to reduce dimensions and optimize the model.

*Key Libraries Used:*
---
* NumPy, Pandas for data manipulation.
* Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly for data visualization.
* Scikit-learn for model building and evaluation.
